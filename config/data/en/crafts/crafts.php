        'description' => 'Crochet is a fiber craft built with a single hook, creating fabric from loops of yarn. It is versatile and beginner-friendly, yet capable of very complex shapes thanks to increases, decreases, and working in the round. Crochet shines for amigurumi, lace, blankets, accessories, and textured garments. Because stitches can be added or removed quickly, it is great for experimenting with color changes and stitch patterns. The resulting fabric often has a clear, sturdy structure and excellent drape control.'

        'description' => 'Embroidery decorates fabric using needle and thread, adding texture, color, and detail through stitches. It can be done by hand on hoops or frames, ranging from simple outlines to dense fills and shading. Common techniques include backstitch, satin stitch, French knots, and long-and-short stitch. Embroidery is ideal for personalizing clothing, mending with visible stitches, creating patches, or making framed art. It rewards patience and precision, and it pairs beautifully with other textile projects.'

        'description' => 'Hand sewing uses needle and thread to join, repair, and shape fabric without a machine. It includes essential stitches like running stitch, backstitch, whipstitch, ladder stitch, and basting. Hand sewing is perfect for small repairs, hemming, attaching buttons, finishing seams, and working on delicate or tight areas. It is also a meditative craft that encourages careful construction and strong technique. With good thread choice and tension, hand-sewn seams can be durable, neat, and beautifully finished.'

        'description' => 'Knitting creates fabric by forming interlocking loops with two needles (or circular needles). It produces stretchy, warm textiles and is especially suited to garments like sweaters, socks, hats, and scarves. Basic techniques include knit and purl stitches, shaping with increases and decreases, and working flat or in the round. Knitting offers a huge range of textures, from smooth stockinette to intricate cables and lace. It is a great craft for colorwork, and careful gauge control helps achieve a comfortable fit.'

        'description' => 'Machine knitting uses a knitting machine to form stitches quickly and consistently. It can produce smooth fabrics and large panels far faster than hand knitting, making it excellent for garments, accessories, and yardage. While the machine does much of the stitch formation, the maker still controls tension, yarn choice, shaping, and finishing. Techniques often include ribbing, tuck stitches, slip stitches, and color changes. Many projects require hand work for seaming and details, blending efficiency with craftsmanship and design planning.'

        'description' => 'Machine sewing uses a sewing machine to stitch fabric with speed and precision. It is the foundation of garment making, quilting, and many home projects like bags, curtains, and pillow covers. Key skills include accurate cutting, seam allowances, pressing, and choosing the right needle, thread, and stitch length for the fabric. Techniques such as zippers, buttonholes, topstitching, and understitching improve fit and finish. Machine sewing is efficient for long seams, while hand stitching still helps with details and clean finishes.'

        'description' => 'Macrame is a textile craft based on knotting cords to create decorative and functional pieces. Using knots like square knots, half hitches, and lark’s head knots, you can build patterns that feel both geometric and organic. Macrame is popular for wall hangings, plant hangers, belts, bags, and jewelry. It works especially well with cotton rope and cords of different thicknesses, often finished with fringes or wrapped sections. The craft is approachable, highly visual, and rewarding for experimenting with texture and symmetry.'

        'description' => 'Tunisian crochet combines features of knitting and crochet, using a long hook to hold multiple loops on the hook like a needle. Each row typically has a forward pass that picks up loops and a return pass that works them off, creating a dense, textured fabric. It is great for blankets, scarves, and structured garments, and it shows colorwork beautifully with minimal stretch distortion. Popular stitches include Tunisian simple stitch and Tunisian knit stitch. With the right hook and yarn, it can drape softly or stay firm and architectural.'
